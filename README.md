## Reporting issues
Please use GitHub issues to report any bugs, user experience/API issues and enhancement proposals. Use the following template while reporting an issue:

#### Description
A brief (1-2 sentences) description of the problem/suggestion.

#### Minimal working example
Include a minimal example required to reproduce the issue, if applicable. Keep it brief and as general and abstract as possible. Minimize code specific to your project. Wrap your code in Markdown code blocks.

Example:
````
```python
# your code goes here
from imgtools.ops import resample
resampled_image = resample(image)
```
````

*Observed behaviour:*
Include the output or brief description of what **actually** happens, if applicable. Again, use Markdown code blocks to separate program output:
````
```
>>> resampled_image.GetSpacing()
(1., 1., 1.)
```
````

*Expected behaviour:*
Include a brief description of what you expect to happen, if applicable.
