# Tutorials

For getting a deeper understanding of the package, we have provided with multiple google collabs which showcases
different functionalities of med-imagetools

## Tutorial 1: Forming Dataset with med-imagetools Autopipeline

Autopipeline is one of the main features of med-imagetools which turns messy raw data and processes it taking into account
the different relationships between different modalities. This notebook gives a demo of how the autopipeline can be used

## Tutorial 2: Machine Learning with med-imagetools and torchio

This tutorial will showcase how we can form Machine Learning pipeline with the help of med-imagetools and torchio. In this notebook we will go through segmentation of body from head and neck cancer dataset
